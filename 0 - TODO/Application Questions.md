### Questions
1. Describe a recent project where you utilized both front-end and back-end technologies. What were your key challenges, and how did you overcome them? Please include specific technologies you used and the reasons behind your choices.

### Answers

1. I recently worked on a photo backup service for mobile. I used React Native to create a cross-platform mobile application for selecting and uploading photos. For the backend, I used AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and Go. A challenge I faced was getting all of the services to work well with binary data for the files. This was a challenge because many of the tools I was working with handled this binary data differently and I didn't want to build all of my dependencies from scratch. I am overall happy with the stack I chose because it is designed to be scalable and highly available.
