### Overview
We need to return the index the pillow is at after `time` swaps. The pillow is exchanged from left to right until it gets the the end of the array, where it will change direction and be swapped right to left. 

### Observations
We can see the number of swaps is (N-1) where `N` is the number of people in the line. Additionally, the pillow will start swapping at `time` = 1.

### Strategy
With there being (N-1) number of swaps, both left-to-right and right-to-left, we can use [[Modulus]] to determine the position the pillow will be after a number of `cycles`. We can calculate the cycles by dividing (time // N-1). 

### Explanation
An even number of cycles means we will be moving left-to-right, and an odd number of cycles means we will be moving right-to-left.
