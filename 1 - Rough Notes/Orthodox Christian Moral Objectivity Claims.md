### Overview
Orthodox Christians claim their morality derived from the Bible and Orthodox Church is objective because it is based on:
- An unchanging Divine Nature: God's perfect and immutable character is the ultimate source of moral law
- Authoritative Revelation: The Bible and Church teachings provide clear, definitive guidance on moral issues.
- Universal Application: Moral laws are binding for all people, transcending cultural and temporal boundaries.
