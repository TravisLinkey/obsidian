### Overview
We are given two strings, `s1` and `s2` and we need to determine if any permutations of `s1` exist in `s2`.

### Strategy
Since a permutation means **some arrangement** of the characters in `s1`, we can use the data structure of a [[Frequency Table]] to measure the counts of `s1`. 

Once we have the counts we need, we can just loop thru `s2`, comparing the counts of a [[Sliding Window]] of the size of our target string, `s1`

### Explanation
We create both counters, loop thru `s2`, and compare each window.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def checkInclusion(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        N1 = len(s1)
        N2 = len(s2)
        
        f1 = collections.Counter(s1)
        fWindow = collections.Counter()
        
        left = 0
        for right in range(N2):
            fWindow[s2[right]] += 1
            left = right - N1
            
            if left >= 0:
                fWindow[s2[left]] -= 1
                
            if fWindow == f1:
                return True
            
            
        return False
```
### Time Complexity
Looping over `s2` -> `O(n)`
Comparing `f1` to `fWindow` -> `O(N1)`

Total time complexity -> `O(n)`
