## Description

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

Forms a core philosophy for methodologies such as [[Agile Development]] and [[Adaptive Software Development]]


- [[Single-Responsibility Principle]]: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.

- [[Open-Closed Principle]]: "Software entities.. should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

- [[Liskov Substitution Principle]]: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."

- [[Interface Segregation Principle]]: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."

- [[Dependency Inversion Principle]]: "Depend upon abstractions, not concrete implementations"
