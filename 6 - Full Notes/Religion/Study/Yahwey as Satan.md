### Overview
Early Greek ideas were based on [[Platonism]] and the idea of the [[Platonic Realm of Forms]]. This informed the earliest Christian sects that created the idea of Heaven.

The issue with this interpretation is it collapses the idea that God 'wants' us to be saved. A perfect God does not want for anything. (Hence apathy, [[Demiurge]])

Additionally, [[Yahwey]] admits in The Bible that he is a "jealous" god. This does not align with the idea of a 'perfect' being, but it does align with the idea of [[Demiurge]].
