### Overview
The [[14th Amendment]] prohibits descrimination towards individuals based on Race or Religion.

#### Thomas Sowell Quotes: "The transparent dishonesty with which quotas have been maintained here in the US is a dishonesty reaching into the highest court in the land as demonstrated in the Webber case."

From the case wikipedia: "Weber claimed the filling of craft trainee positions pursuant to the affirmative action program had resulted in junior black employees' receiving training in preference to senior white employees, thus discriminating against him and other white employees in violation of §§ 703(a) and (d) of [[Title VII]]"

The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] mentions individuals. Justice Brennan decided this does not apply to groups. If it did, `Affirmative Action` would not be possible.

### The Result
Affirmative Action programs and policies have grown, and now cover groups, (Minorities and Women), that now account for the substantial **majority** of the American population.

This idea leads to completely different outcomes than intended, where in many instances you end up hurting minority groups.

#### Examples
- San Francisco High School - whites are admitted with lower test scores than Asians. 
- Medical Schools - sons of black doctors have an advantage over sons of white doctors to be admitted into medical school.
- College Education - White women have benefitted from Affirmative Action more so than blacks. The per capita of women receiving higher education due to affirmative action is dispropotionate to blacks. This makes blacks worse off because the number of jobs requiring a degree has expanded, and a Black man who does not possess this degree may be overlooked for someone who is more likely to go to college, (A white woman).

### Analysis
This applies to more than just the US; India and other countries as well. The reason is because it is politically popular to continually give favors to larger and larger populations.
There is a political advantage to give promises to "marginalized" groups, and the political penalty for refusing to do so is devistating.
