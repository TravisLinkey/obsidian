## Higher Normal Form


### Overview

- Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): A stricter version of [[Third Normal Form]] where every determinant must be a candidate key.
- Fourth Normal Form (4NF): Ensures no multi-valued dependencies other than a candidate key.
- Fifth Normal Form (5NF): Ensure no join dependencies exist in the database.
