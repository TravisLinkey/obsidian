# MonoQueue

A MonoQueue, or monotone priority queue structures the queue in such a way that the elements are in a strictly increasing or decreasing order. 

This is a helpful technique for a number of problems, like [[Sliding Window]] problems where you need to keep track of the largest (or smallest) element by keeping it at the head of the queue.
