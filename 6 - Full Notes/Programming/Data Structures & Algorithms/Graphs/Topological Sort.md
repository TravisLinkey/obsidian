### Overview
A topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node `v` is visted only after all of its dependencies are visited.

### Use Cases
Vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another. In this context, topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks.
