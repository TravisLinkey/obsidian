### Overview
When getting the error: "you don't have permission to push to this repository"

### Solution
Go to github.com (Access Token page)[https://github.com/settings/tokens] and generate a `Personal Access Token`

The error will ask you to log in using your username and **password**.

Your username is just the email, and the **password** is the `Personal Access Token` that you generated.
