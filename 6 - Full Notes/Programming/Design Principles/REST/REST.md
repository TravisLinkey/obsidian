**Representational State Transfer**

A software architecture that imposes conditions on how an API should work.

### Concepts:
1. **Stateless** - each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.

2. **Client-Server Architecture** - Separates the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns.

3. **Uniform Interface** - Defines a standardized way for resources to be accessed and manipulated via URIs, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and standard [[HTTP Status Codes]]

4. **Resource-Based** - Resources are identified by URIs and can be represented in various formats like JSON or XML.
