Transmission Control Protocol is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocols suite.

It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol. Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.  (Internet Protocol)

### Overview

Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, and file transfer rely on TCP, which is part of the [[Transport Layer]] of the TCP/IP suite.

[[SSL-TLS]] often runs on top of TCP.

### Details

- Connection-oriented, meaning that sender and receiver firstly need to establish a connection based on agreed parameters; which is done through a three way handshake.
- The server must be listening (passive open) for connection requests
