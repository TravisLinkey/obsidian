### Overview
A programming paradigm that focuses on describing what the program should accomplish, rather than explicitly defining how to achieve it.

In declarative programming, you write expressions or statements that specify the desired outcomes or logic, and the underlying system or language figures out the details of how to execute those instructions.

### Examples
- [[SQL]] - with queries you describe what data you want from a database, but not how the database engine should retrieve the data.
- [[Terraform]]
- [[HTML]]
- [[CSS]]
