### Overview
A function that always produces the same output for the same input and has no side effects. (it does not alter external state, such as modifying a global variable or writing to a file).

They are deterministic, easier to understand, and more predictable.

### Example
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
