## Overview

The process of storing a large database across multiple machines.

A single machine, or database server, can store and process only limited amount of data. Database sharding overcomes this limitation by splitting the data into smaller chunks, (shards) and storing them across several database servers.

### Benefits

- It enables parallel processing of smaller datasets across shards.
- Faster queries
- Distributed database increases durability and availability of data
- Scaling efficiently
