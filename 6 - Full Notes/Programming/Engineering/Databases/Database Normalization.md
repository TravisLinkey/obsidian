### Overview

A way of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The goal is to ensure that each piece of data is stored only once and to maintain logical data structures.

### Benefits
1. Reduce Redundancy
2. Improve Data Integrity
3. Simplify Maintenance
4. Enhance Query Performance

### How to do it

Database normalization is typically done in stages, called **Normal Forms**, each building on the previous one.

## Normal Forms

- [[First Normal Form]]
- [[Second Normal Form]]
- [[Third Normal Form]]
- [[Higher Normal Form]]

### Summary

Database normalization is a cucial part of designing a database schema to ensure efficiency, consistency, and integrity of data. It involves decomposing a table into smaller tables and defining relationships between them to reduce redundancy and avoid undesirable characteristics like insertion, update and deletion anomolies.
