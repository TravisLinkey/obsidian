### Overview
This problem wants us to find the path that goes from `start_node` to `end_node` with the maximum probability. Each edge from `u` to `v` has a probability associated with it. Each new edge should multiply the current probability to the new edge weight. (Not add, multiply)

### Strategy
This is a [[Greedy]] problem because the path with the maximum probability will have sub paths that also have the maximum probabilies. 

In other words, we should traverse the edges in the order of highest probability first. In order to do this, we will use a [[MaxHeap]] to store the neighbor nodes and the current path probability, similar to [[Djikstra's]] algorithm.

When we arrive at the `end_node`, we know we have found the maximum probabilty, because we took the optimal path.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProbability(self, N: int, edges: List[List[int]], succProb: List[float], start_node: int, end_node: int) -> float:
        done = [False] * N
        best = [0.0] * N
        
        adj_list = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for (u, v), w in zip(edges, succProb):
            adj_list[u].append([v, w])
            adj_list[v].append([u, w])

        best[start_node] = 1.0
        h = []
        heapq.heappush(h, [-1.0, start_node])

        while h:
            prob, cur = heapq.heappop(h)
            prob = -prob
            
            if done[cur]:
                continue
            
            done[cur] = True

            for neigh, w in adj_list[cur]:
                    q = prob * w
                    
                    if not done[neigh] and q > best[neigh]:
                        best[neigh] = q
                        heapq.heappush(h, [-q, neigh])
            
        return best[end_node]
```
