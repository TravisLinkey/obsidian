### Overview
This problem wants us to find the **maximum distance** between two **sorted** arays in a matrix.

### Observation
Since these arrays are sorted, we know the maximum distances needs to be the first entry of one array, and the last entry in another array.

### Strategy
We can simply iterate through each array, (row), keeping track of the smallest number, and the largest number.

### Explanation
Each iteration, check the difference between the current row smallest with the largest we have found, and the current row largest with the smallest we have found. 

Save this as the `max_distance` and update the smallest and largest found with the current row if necessary.

### Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxDistance(self, arrays):
        R = len(arrays)
        smallest = arrays[0][0]
        largest = arrays[0][-1]
        max_distance = -10 ** 9

        for i in range(1, R):
            max_distance = max(max_distance, abs(smallest - arrays[i][-1]), abs(largest - arrays[i][0]))
            smallest = min(smallest, arrays[i][0])
            largest = max(largest, arrays[i][-1])

        return max_distance
```
