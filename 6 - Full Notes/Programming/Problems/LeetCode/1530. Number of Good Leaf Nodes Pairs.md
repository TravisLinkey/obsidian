### Overview
This problem is asking us to find all leaf node pairs (two leaves) that have a distance less than or equal to `distance`.

In other words, a good leaf node pair is when two leaf nodes have less than `distance` number of edges connecting them.

### Strategy
To accomplish this, we will simply do a [[DFS]] to get the leaf nodes, and at each node, return the left and right subtree distances (edges) as a list.

Additionally, at each node, we will loop through the left subtree pairs and right subtree pairs, calculating the distances to see if we have a match. ie. the pairs distances are less than or equal to `distance`.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, root: TreeNode, distance: int) -> int:
        self.total = 0

        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return []

            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return [1]

            left_pairs = dfs(node.left)
            right_pairs = dfs(node.right)

            for d1 in left_pairs:
                for d2 in right_pairs:
                    if d1 + d2 <= distance:
                        self.total += 1

            all_pairs = left_pairs + right_pairs
            return [d + 1 for d in all_pairs]

        dfs(root)
        return self.total

```
