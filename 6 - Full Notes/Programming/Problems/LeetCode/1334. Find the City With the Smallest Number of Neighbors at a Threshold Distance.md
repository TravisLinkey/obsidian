### Overview
Given a list of edges between cities, and weights between those edges, this problem wants us to determine which city has the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path with a total distance less than `distanceThreshold`. If there is a tie, return the city that has the larger value.

### Strategy
We know that [[Floyd-Warshall]] algorithm gives us the the shortest path for **every pair of nodes** in a weighted graph. This is a perfect solution to our problem.

### Explanation
We can simply use Floyd-Warshall algorithm to calculate all shortest paths, (for every node to every other node), and iterate over the nodes (1 to N), calculating how many neighbors are reachable using `distanceThreshold`. Return the city with the smallest amount of reachable nodes. 


### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheCity(self, N: int, edges: List[List[int]], distanceThreshold: int) -> int:
        INF = 10 ** 9
        distance = [[INF] * N for _ in range(N)]

        for i in range(N):
            distance[i][i] = 0

        for u, v, w in edges:
            distance[u][v] = w
            distance[v][u] = w

        for k in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                for i in range(N):
                    distance[i][j] = min(distance[i][j], distance[i][k] + distance[k][j])

        best_city = None
        total_reachable = INF
        for i in range(N):
            reachable = 0

            for j in range(N):
                if distance[i][j] <= distanceThreshold:
                    reachable += 1

            if reachable <= total_reachable:
                best_city = i
                total_reachable = reachable

        return best_city
```
