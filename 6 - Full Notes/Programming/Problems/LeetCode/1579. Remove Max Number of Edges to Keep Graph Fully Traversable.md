### Overview
We need to remove the max number of edges from the graph to keep it traversable by both Alice and Bob. Keep in mind there are some number of edges that both Alice and Bob can use.

### Strategy
This problem is essentially asking us to create a [[Minimum Spanning Tree]] for both Bob and Alice where we will try to use as many shared edges as possible.

A good way to solve this problem, (and minimum spanning trees in general) is to use [[Union Find]] to incrementally build the MST for both Alice and Bob, one edge at a time. 

### Explanation
To optimize our MST, in a [[Greedy]] way, would be to start with only the edges that they share.
