Tag: [[Leetcode]] | [[Graph]] | [[DFS]]

## Overview
The problem asks us to create a [[Deep Copy]], (completely new graph) of a graph. 

## Solution
Use a DFS to traverse thru the graph. Keep a lookup table which maps old nodes to the newly created nodes.

Each node you visit, create a new node and add it to the lookup table. For each visited node, DFS on the neighbors and return the newly created node when all the neighbors have been processed.
