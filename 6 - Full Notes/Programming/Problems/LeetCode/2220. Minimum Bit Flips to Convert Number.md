### Overview
This problem wants us to determine how many bits in the number `start` need to be flipped to create `goal`.

In other words, we just need to count the number of bits in `start` and `goal` that are different. 

### Strategy
The binary operation known as [[xor]] (`^` in python) can be used to determine if two bits match. 

If we *xor* two numbers, we will get a new number where each bit is `exclusionary` or'ed. In other words, it is a new number created by **xor**ing each bit in `start` and `goal`

### Explanation
After taking the `xor` of `start` and `goal`, we just need to count the number of '1's in the result.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minBitFlips(self, start: int, goal: int) -> int:
        return bin(start ^ goal)[2:].count("1")
```
