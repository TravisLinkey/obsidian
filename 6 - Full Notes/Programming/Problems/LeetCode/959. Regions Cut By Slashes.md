### Overview
The problem gives us a `n x n` grid where tiles can either contain one of three characters: `/`, `\\` or ` ` (an empty space).

These characters divide the square into contiguous regions, and we need to determine how many continguous regions the grid contains.

### Strategy
This problem is asking us to count connected components in the graph, where each component can be determined by using the algorithm [[Flood Fill]].

In other words, we can perform a [[BFS]] once we have correctly blown up the grid, (each `1 x 1` tile will be replaced with a `3 x 3` square), to determine which tiles are connected to one another. Where the barriers are created by the slash characters of the original grid.

### Explanation
First we will created the new scaled up grid, `n x n` grid becomes new `3n x 3n` grid. Initialize this new grid with the proper barriers by iterating through each square and filling the diagonals when we have a slash character in the original grid. 

The last thing we need to do is just iterate through the new grid, and perform a [[BFS]], ([[Flood Fill]]), on each cell that is not filled. Each [[BFS]] we perform increases the connected `component` count. Return the count `component`.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def regionsBySlashes(self, grid: List[str]) -> int:
        R, C = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        ngrid = [[False] * (C * 3) for _ in range(R * 3)]
        
        # initialize new grid - create barriers
        for x in range(R):
            for y in range(C):
                if grid[x][y] == "\\":
                    ngrid[x*3][y*3] = ngrid[x*3+1][y*3+1] = ngrid[x*3+2][y*3+2] = True
                elif grid[x][y] == "/":
                    ngrid[x*3+2][y*3] = ngrid[x*3+1][y*3+1] = ngrid[x*3][y*3+2] = True
        
        directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        def fill(sx, sy):
            q = collections.deque()
            q.append((sx, sy))
            ngrid[sx][sy] = True

            while q:
                x, y = q.popleft()

                for dx, dy in directions:
                    nx, ny = dx+x, dy+y

                    if nx in range(R * 3) and ny in range(C * 3) and not ngrid[nx][ny]:
                        ngrid[nx][ny] = True
                        q.append((nx, ny))

        # iterate through new grid - counting total components
        components = 0
        for x in range(R * 3):
            for y in range(C * 3):
                if not ngrid[x][y]:
                    components += 1
                    fill(x, y)
        return components
```
