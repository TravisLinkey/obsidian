### Overview
This problem wants us to find all subsets (i, j, k) where the elements at i, j, k are strictly increasing or decreasing.

### Strategy
Two observations make this problem much simpler:

First, notice that for all j, we just need the count of elements smaller than j to the left, and elements larger than j to the right. We can use this same idea to determine all strictly increasing and decreasing pairs.  

Second, we can leverage a built in container in [[Python]] called [[SortedList]] which will allow us to determine the number of elements smaller than our current element, (and larger with the compliment) using [[bisect_left]].

### Explanation
We just need to loop through `ratings` left to right using [[SortedList]] and [[bisect_left]] to count the number of elements smaller than the current element stored in `smaller_left`. We reverse the list and do the same to get the array `smaller_right`.

With that, loop through `ratings` again, using `j` as the index, and get the `smaller_left[j]` and `smaller_right[j]` (take the compliment to get `right_bigger`), to calculate the total pairs that match our condition. (striclty increasing). 

We can abstract this into a function that we can call called `get_total` so that we may call it again to get the total count of strictly decreasing as well. The solution is just the number of strictly increasing (`get_total(ratings)`), plus the number of strictly decreasing, (`get_total(ratings[::-1])`)

### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class Solution:
    def numTeams(self, rating: List[int]) -> int:
        N = len(rating)
        def get_total(rating):
            def get_smaller(rating):
                smaller = []
                seen = SortedList()

                for x in rating:
                    smaller.append(seen.bisect_left(x))
                    seen.add(x)

                return smaller

            smaller_left = get_smaller(rating)
            smaller_right = get_smaller(rating[::-1])[::-1]

            total = 0
            for j in range(N):
                left_smaller = smaller_left[j]
                right_bigger = (N - j - 1) - smaller_right[j]

                total += left_smaller * right_bigger

            return total
        return get_total(rating) + get_total(rating[::-1])
```
