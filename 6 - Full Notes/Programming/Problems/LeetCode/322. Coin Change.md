### Overview
This problem wants us to give the minimum number of change back given some `amount` and some `coins`. Intuitively we know we should use the largest coins first.

### Strategy
We can use [[Dynamic Programming]] and [[Recursion]] to process the coins. Each recursive step, we will iterate through the sorted coins, (largest to smallest), and take the coin if it is less than or equal to our current amount. 

This means we will need to carry with us the current amount for each recursive call, and return the amount of total coins used. 

### Explanation
We can also use [[Memoization]] to ensure we are not processing the same states twice. In other words, when we have seen a particular `amount` before, we will use the cached result to ensure we are not doing duplicate processing.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        INF = 10 ** 20
        has_cache = [False] * (amount+1)
        cache = [None] * (amount+1)

        def count(remaining):
            if remaining == 0:
                return 0

            if has_cache[remaining]:
                return cache[remaining]
            
            best = INF
            for coin in sorted(coins)[::-1]:
                if coin <= remaining:
                    best = min(best, count(remaining-coin) + 1)
            
            has_cache[remaining] = True
            cache[remaining] = best
            return best
        
        ans = count(amount)
        return ans if ans != INF else -1
```
