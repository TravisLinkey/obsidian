### Overview
This problem uses parentheses to group substrings that will need to be reversed. This operation will happen in the order of the most deeply nested pair of parentheses first.

### Strategy
We know that string problems that use parentheses pairs to group substrings lend themselves well to using a [[Stack]]. This allows us to seperate the left pairs (on the stack) with the right pairs (in the unprocessed string). Another great feature of a stack is that characters on the stack will be returned in a reverse order, which is what this problem requires.

### Explanation
We can loop through the string `s` and continually push characters on the string until we see the first right parenthesis ")". Now we will pop from the stack until we see the first left parenthesis "(". Store this partition in an array and reverse it, this is the inner-most word, reversed. Store it back on the stack, it is in the correct order.

Continue this process until we finish looping through  `s`, the stack now contains our correctly reversed string.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseParentheses(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        
        for c in s:
            if c == ")":
                portion = []
                while stack[-1] != "(":
                    portion.append(stack.pop())
                stack.pop()
                stack.extend(portion)
            else:
                stack.append(c)
        
        return "".join(stack)

```
