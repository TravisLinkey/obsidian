### Overview
Robots are standing in a line and can move one of two directions infinitely, Left or Right. When two robots occupy the same space, there is a collision where the robot with smaller health is destroyed, and the surviving robot has its health decreased by 1 point.

We need to return an array of robots that survive after all possible collisions happen.

### Strategy
We can use a stack to hold robots that will no longer collide with each other, (They are moving different directions). We can use a [[Lookup Table]] to map the robots position to an index. As we loop through each robot position in the `positions` array, we will compare that robot direction to the top of the stack, and perform the necessary collision calculations in the `healths` array for each of the respective robots.

### Explanation
Use the [[Lookup Table]] to create a connection between each position with an index. These indices will be used in both the `directions` and `health` arrays. The [[Stack]] will also contain indices that can be used for all the arrays. (positions, directions, healths)


### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def survivedRobotsHealths(self, positions: List[int], healths: List[int], directions: str) -> List[int]:
        index_map = { p:i for i, p in enumerate(positions) }
        
        stack = []

        for p in sorted(positions):
            i = index_map[p]

            if directions[i] == "R":
                stack.append(i)
            else:
                while stack and directions[stack[-1]] == "R" and healths[i]:
                    i2 = stack.pop()

                    if healths[i2] < healths[i]:
                        healths[i2] = 0
                        healths[i] -= 1
                    elif healths[i2] > healths[i]:
                        healths[i] = 0
                        healths[i2] -= 1
                        stack.append(i2)
                    else:
                        healths[i] = healths[i2] = 0

                if healths[i]:
                    stack.append(i)
        return [x for x in healths if x > 0]

```
