### Overview
This problem wants us to create a calendar (list of events) that allows for double booking, but not triple booking.

### Strategy
This can be achieved by keeping track of two lists, the single booked events (no overlaps) and the double booked events (only one overlap). In short, we can determine any event that would cause a triple booking by simply checking if there is already a double booking given that event start and end times.

### Observations
First, when we are creating the double booking, we only care about the pieces of the two events that overlap. See below:

```python
             0123456789
    Event A: |------|   [0,7]
    Event B:     |----| [4,9]

    Overlapping: |--|   [4,7]  -> [max(A_start, B_start), min(A_end, B_end)]
```
In this example, we can see that the overlapping section is from [4, 7] which can be calculated as: [max(a_start, b_start), min(a_end, b_end)]

Lastly, we need to be sure to add every event to the `single_booked` list, even if they cause a `double_booked` event. 

### Code
```python
class MyCalendarTwo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.single_booked = []
        self.double_booked = []

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        
        # causes triple booking
        for s, e in self.double_booked:
            if end > s and e > start:
                return False
        
        # causes double booking
        for s, e in self.single_booked:
            if end > s and e > start:
                new_start, new_end = max(s, start), min(e, end)
                self.double_booked.append((new_start, new_end))
        
        # no overlaps
        self.single_booked.append((start, end))
        return True
            
```
### Time Complexity
- Loop thru `double_booked` list -> `O(n)`
- Loop thru `single_booked` list -> `O(n)`
- Overall time complexity: `O(n)`
