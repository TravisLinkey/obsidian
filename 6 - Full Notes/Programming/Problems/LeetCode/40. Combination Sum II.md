### Overview
This problem wants us to return the combinations in `candidates` that sum to `target`.

A catch to this problem is we need to return only **unique** combinations. 

### Strategy
We can view this problem as a simple [[Dynamic Programming]] problem, where at each index we have the choice, `Use this index or do not`. Because the candidates are only positive, we know that we only care about elements that when added to the sum are **less than or equal to** our target.

### Explanation
To ensure we do not create duplicate combinations, we need to be clever and skip potential duplicates. Duplicates happen when we start a combination with the same element as a previously created combination. To remove potential duplicate combinations, we can sort the array and keep a [[Lookup Table]] (or array) called `next_index` to store where the next available index is.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum2(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        N = len(candidates)
        candidates.sort()

        next_index = [N] * N

        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                if candidates[i] != candidates[j]:
                    next_index[i] = j
                    break

        ans = []
        def get_combo(index, target, current):
            if target == 0:
                ans.append(current[:])
                return

            if index == N:
                return

            # take
            if target >= candidates[index]:
                current.append(candidates[index])
                get_combo(index+1, target-candidates[index], current)
                current.pop()

            # dont take - skip answers with duplicate elements
            get_combo(next_index[index], target, current)

        get_combo(0, target, [])
        return ans
```
