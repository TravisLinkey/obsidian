### Overview
This problem wants us to find the K-th smallest pair `a` and `b` in an array `nums` where the pair is defined as the absolute difference between `a` and `b` that is less than or equal to `target`.

A brute force approach would be to find "all pairs" and return the K-th smallest pair.

### Strategy
Rather than search for each pair, (this would be `O(n^2)`), we should perform a binary search `O(log n)`, to find all pairs that have absolute distance less than or equal to `target`.

### Explanation
To optimize our search, we should sort the array `nums`, and binary search for the `K`, where we will use a window size (right - left) to determine the `count` of pairs that are less than or equal to our `target`.

By checking that `count` is greater than or equal to `k` as our invariant, we can shift the right pointer of the [[Binary Search]] each iteration, to eventually yield the smallest possible distance between pairs.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def smallestDistancePair(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        N = len(nums)
        nums.sort()

        left = 0
        right = nums[-1]

        # There are 'k' smaller or equal pairs
        def good(target):
            count = 0

            right = 0
            for left in range(N):
                while right < N and nums[right] - nums[left] <= target:
                    right += 1
                count += right - left - 1

            return count >= k

        while left < right:
            mid = (right + left) // 2

            if good(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1

        return left
```
