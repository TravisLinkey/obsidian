### Overview
This problem gives us a list of `m` dice rolls (values in range [1, 6]), and a number `n` which represents the number of missing dice rolls. We are additionally given the `mean` or average of all the dice rolls, including the missing dice rolls. 

We need to determine a possible list of `n` length for dice rolls where the average of all dice rolls is equal to `mean`.

### Strategy
Using the information they give us, we can derive the sum of the missing `n` dice rolls. We can then be [[Greedy]] to determine a list of missing dice rolls.

### Explanation
First, use the following logic to get the sum of the list of dice rolls `n`. We know there are two sums that equal the total, `total_M` and `total_N`. We are given `total_M`.

We also know `mean` is `total_M + total_N` divided by `M + N`. Putting this all together, we derive `total_N` equals `mean * (M + N) - total_M`.

Instantiate the list `ans` (of size `n`) with all "1"s and loop thru `n` possible slots, continuously subtracting from `total_N`, and distributing the "possible" dice rolls, (for simplicity we will choose '6' or the leftover `total_N`), into the array `ans`.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def missingRolls(self, rolls: List[int], mean: int, N: int) -> List[int]:
        M = len(rolls)
        total_M = sum(rolls)
        
        # total = (total_M + total_N)
        # mean = (total_M + total_N) / (M + N)
        # mean * (M + N) = total_M + total_N
        # total_N = mean * (M + N) - total_M
        
        total_N = mean * (M + N) - total_M
        
        # check if it is possible
        if not (N * 1 <= total_N <= N * 6):
            return []
        
        # start with possible ans
        needed = total_N
        ans = [1] * N
        needed -= N
        
        for i in range(N):
            delta = min(5, needed) 
            ans[i] += delta
            needed -= delta
        
        return ans
```
