### Overview
This problem wants us to delete nodes (possibly parent nodes) and return a list of disjoint trees and subtrees that are created.


### Strategy
We can see that the subtree becomes disjoint when the parent of the subtree has been deleted. We also know that we will need to traverse the tree, processing the leaves first.

This makes [[Postorder Traversal]] a good choice for processing the tree.


### Explanation
We should keep a flag at each recursive step called `parentDeleted` to determine if the current subtree we are working on will need to be added to the answer as a disjoint tree.

Basically, we just want to traverse the tree with a [[Postorder Traversal]] and pass to each recursive step whether the current node will be deleted. If so, add current node to the ans array.


### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def delNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], to_delete: List[int]) -> List[TreeNode]:
        levels = []
        def post_order(node, parentDeleted):
            if not node:
                return None
            
            toDelete = node.val in to_delete

            node.left = post_order(node.left, toDelete)
            node.right = post_order(node.right, toDelete)

            if not toDelete and parentDeleted:
                levels.append(node)
            return None if toDelete else node

        post_order(root, True)
        return levels
```
