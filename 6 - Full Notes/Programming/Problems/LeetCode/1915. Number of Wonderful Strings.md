### Overview
We need to count all substrings that are *wonderful* in a string `s`. A wonderful substring is one where **at most** one letter appears and **odd** number of times.

ie. s = "aba"

wonderful substrings: ["a", "b", "a", "aba"]

### Strategy
The idea here is to use a bitmask to represent the parity for each character in the current substring. In order to do this, we will convert the character to an integer (ordinal), and flip the bit at the current ordinal value (create the bitmask for character `char`). In Python, this can be done: `mask ^= (1 << index)` where index is the ordinal of the character `char`.

### Explanation
At each index we will save the bitmask for this index. We will also check if we have seen this bitmask before. If we have, we know that the substring in between our current index, and the last occurrence of our bitmask is a substring with even parity. 

1. Case "all even parity":

ie. string = "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
              ^        ^ 
            mask      mask

At these indices, there is a substring in between with an even parity. (odd - odd = even) (even - even = even)

2. Case "at most one odd":
(odd - even = odd)
(even - odd = odd)


*** Be sure to keep a dictionary accumulator to keep a count of how many times we have seen each mask.
