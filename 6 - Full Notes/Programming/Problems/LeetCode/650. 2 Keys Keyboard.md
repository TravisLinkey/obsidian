### Overview
We are given a notepad with the letter 'A' on it, and two possible operations we can perform, `copy` and `paste`. This problem wants us to deterine the minimum number of operations we need to perform to get 'A' exactly `n` times on the screen.

In other words, how many times can we either `copy` or `paste` some clipboard to optimally reach `n` consective letters of 'A'?

### Observation
Since we can only perform two operations at each step, `copy` and `paste`, we can deduce that this would be a [[Dynamic Programming]] problem. 

### Strategy
Each recursive step we have a `current` which represents the current count of consecutive letters of 'A', and `clipboard` which represents the number of 'A's we can use to perform a `paste` operation.

### Explanation
To avoid infinite looping, we should only perform the `copy` when the `current` and `clipboard` do not match. And we should only paste when there is something in our `clipboard`.

Write a handler function to perform each recursive step and kick it off with `current=1` and `clipboard=0`.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, N: int) -> int:
        INF = 10 ** 9

        has_cache = [[False] * (N) for _ in range(N)]
        cache = [[None] * (N) for _ in range(N)]

        def count(current, clipboard):
            if current > N:
                return INF

            if current == N:
                return 0

            if has_cache[current][clipboard]:
                return cache[current][clipboard]

            best = INF
            # copy again
            if current != clipboard:
                best = min(best, count(current, current) + 1)

            # paste
            if clipboard and current+clipboard <= N:
                best = min(best, count(current+clipboard, clipboard) + 1)
            
            has_cache[current][clipboard] = True
            cache[current][clipboard] = best
            return best

        return count(1, 0)
```
