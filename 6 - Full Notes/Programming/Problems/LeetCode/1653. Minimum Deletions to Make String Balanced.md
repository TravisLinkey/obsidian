### Overview
This problem gives us a string `s` and we need to group the string such that all 'a's in the string come before all 'b's in the string by deleting characters. 

Since there are multiple ways to do this, we need to find the solution that deletes the **minimum** amount of characters.

### Strategy
We can try all possible combinations by looping through the list keeping the invariant that everything on the left of our current index only contains 'a's and everything on the right of our current index only contains 'b's.

### Explanation
To accomplish this, we will keep a count `left_b` and `right_a` that will represent the number of 'invalid' characters on the left and right sides. 

We know the total deletions for each index is the sum of `left_b` and `right_a`. We will simply check the total deletions each loop, returning the minimum.


### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        left_b = 0
        right_a = s.count("a")

        best = right_a
        for x in s:
            if x == "b":
                left_b += 1
            else:
                right_a -= 1

            total_deletions = right_a + left_b
            best = min(best, total_deletions)
        return best
```
