### Overview
This problem wants us to determine the final x-y position of a robot that starts at position (0, 0) in a grid with obstacles. The robot can do three different `commands`, turn left (-2), turn right (-1) or move forward `k` units. 

We are given an array `obstacles` and an array of `commands` and must determine what is the final position of the robot.

### Strategy
We can store the obstacles in a `set()` for easy lookup. We will simply process the commands, one by one, applying the moves to our current robot state, which can be stored in an array [x-position, y-position, direction].

### Explanation
At each move, we can do one of three things, turn left (-2), turn right (-1), or continue to walk forward, (loop `k` times). We can use `mod 4` to ensure we are constrained to four directions (north, east, south, west). 

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def robotSim(self, commands: List[int], obstacles: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        directions = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]
        
        obstacle_lookup = set()
        for x, y in obstacles:
            obstacle_lookup.add((x, y))
        
        cur = [0, 0, 0]
        best = 0
        for move in commands:
            x, y, direction = cur
            
            if move == -1:
                # turn right
                direction += 1
                direction %= 4
                cur = [x, y, direction]
            elif move == -2:
                # turn left
                direction -= 1
                direction %= 4
                cur = [x, y, direction]
            else:
                for i in range(move):
                    x, y, direction = cur
                    dx, dy = directions[direction]
                    nx, ny = dx+x, dy+y
                    
                    if (nx, ny) in obstacle_lookup:
                        break
                    else:
                        cur = [nx, ny, direction]
                        
                    x, y, _ = cur
                    best = max(best, x ** 2 + y ** 2)
        return best
        
```
