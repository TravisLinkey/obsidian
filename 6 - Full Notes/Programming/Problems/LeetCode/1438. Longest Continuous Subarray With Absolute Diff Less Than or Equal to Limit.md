### Overview

This problem makes great use of a [[MinQueue]] and [[MaxQueue]] (monotonically increasing / decreasing) to track largest and smallest elements in the current window.

We can maintain the invariant that our [[Sliding Window]] contains only elements where the difference is less than `limit` by shrinking the window left when this invariant is not true. When we shrink the window, we need to check if that leftmost element is in the MinQueue or MaxQueue and pop if it is.
