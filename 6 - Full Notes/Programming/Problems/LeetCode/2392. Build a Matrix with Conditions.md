### Overview
This problem wants us to build a matrix (size k x k) where the row and column conditions are satisfied. The conditions are given as a list or lists where the list [above, below] describes a pair that number `above` should appear before `below`. For example, if the pair was `rowCondition = [2, 1]` this means that the row that contains `2` should appear above the row that contains `1`.

### Strategy
We know that a good solution for dependency graphs is to use a [[Topological Sort]] to determine where elements should appear based on their dependencies.

### Explanation
One thing to look out for is the problem mentions that no graph may exist that satisfies the conditions. We can check for this case using `assert` to ensure we find an ordering for all elements [0, k] for both rows and columns. If the assert fails, we can catch the exception and return an empty array.

An additional trick we can use to get the row and column orderings is to create a [[Lookup Table]] mapping for each ordering to an index.

After creating the dependency ordering mappings for both rows and columns, we just need to loop through the integers [1, k] and use the mappings to determine where in the matrix this element will live.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def buildMatrix(self, K: int, rowConditions: List[List[int]], colConditions: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

        def topSort(conditions):
            prev = collections.defaultdict(list)
            indegrees = [0] * K
            for a, b in conditions:
                a -= 1
                b -= 1

                prev[a].append(b)
                indegrees[a] += 0
                indegrees[b] += 1

            q = collections.deque()
            for i in range(K):
                if indegrees[i] == 0:
                    q.append(i)

            ordering = []
            while q:
                now = q.popleft()
                ordering.append(now)

                for nxt in prev[now]:
                    indegrees[nxt] -= 1

                    if indegrees[nxt] == 0:
                        q.append(nxt)

            assert(len(ordering) == K)
            # Create lookup table for ordering to index
            return {x: i for i, x in enumerate(ordering)}

        try:
            rows = topSort(rowConditions)
            cols = topSort(colConditions)
        except:
            return []

        ans = [[0] * K for _ in range(K)]
        # build the array using the ordering lookup table
        for i in range(K):
            ans[rows[i]][cols[i]] = i + 1
        return ans
```
