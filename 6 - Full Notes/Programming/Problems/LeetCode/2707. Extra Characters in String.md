### Overview
This problem wants us to break a string `s` up into words that can be found in `dictionary` such that we minimize the number of unused characters in `s`.

### Strategy
We can think of this as a [[DAG]] problem where each index can serve as a possible, (or potentially several) different paths, where each path represents a word found in the `dictionary`. 

Starting from the first index, we want to find the branch that has a minimum penalty, where a penalty is defined as a character that does not belong to a word in the dictionary.

### Explanation
We can create a [[Dynamic Programming]] approach where each recursive step we can either use this index to form a word in the dictionary, or go to the next index (and take a penalty). If the letter at the current index forms a word found in the dictionary, move our current index to `index + len(word)` and take no penalty.

Use memoization to ensure we are returning the minimum path.

**Note**: we are able to take advantage of the [[Python]] built in method `.startswith` to check if the current index makes up a word in the `dictionary`.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minExtraChar(self, s: str, dictionary: List[str]) -> int:
        N = len(s)
        INF = 10 ** 20
        
        has_cache = [False] * (N+1)
        cache = [INF] * (N+1)
        
        def search(index):
            if index == N:
                return 0
            
            if has_cache[index]:
                return cache[index]
            
            # skip this index
            best = search(index+1) + 1
            
            for word in dictionary:
                
                # this is a possible start index for word
                if s[index:].startswith(word):
                    L = len(word)
                    best = min(best, search(index+L))
            
            has_cache[index] = True
            cache[index] = best
            return best
        
        return search(0)
```
