### Overview
This problem wants us to determine the largest prefix that can be found in two lists of integers, `arr1` and `arr2`.

### Strategy
Another common name for a [[Trie]] data structure is a [[Prefix Tree]]. Once we build up our tree with `arr1` words, we can easily loop over `arr2` and determine what prefixes are shared. We just need to find the longest shared prefix.

### Explanation
Pretty straighforward, loop over `arr1`, creating the prefix tree. Loop over `arr2`, searching that prefix tree.

### Code
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = {}
        
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = Node()
        
    def add(self, s):
        cur = self.root
        
        for c in s:
            if c not in cur.edges:
                cur.edges[c] = Node()
            cur = cur.edges[c]
    
    def search(self, s):
        cur = self.root        
        running = 0
        
        for c in s:
            if c not in cur.edges:
                break
                
            running += 1
            cur = cur.edges[c]
        
        return running

class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> int:
        trie = Trie()
        
        for word in arr1:
            trie.add(str(word))
            
        best = 0
        for word in arr2:
            v = trie.search(str(word))
            best = max(best, v)
                
        return best
```
### Time Complexity
If we say `arr1` is length `M` and `arr2` is length `N`.
- Create the trie -> `O(M)`
- Loop over words -> `O(N)`
- Time complexity -> `O(M + N)`
