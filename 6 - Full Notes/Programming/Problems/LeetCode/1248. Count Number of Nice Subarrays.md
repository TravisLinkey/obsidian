### Overview

Given a string, we need to find a continuous subarrays that contain 'k' odd numbers.

#### Key Concept

Rather than use a [[Sliding Window]] to count the number of odd numbers, we should use a deque that tracks the indices of the odd numbers. This allows us to calculate the degrees of freedom (number of possible subarrays) at every new index.

The degrees of freedom = last popped odd index - top of deque index + 1

ie:
k = 2

[1,2,2,2,1,1]
 ^-------^
 1,2,2,2,1

Here, the 2s are not considered degrees of freedom

popped index: None
deque: [0,4]
degrees of freedom: None

[1,2,2,2,1,1]
         ^-^
         1,1 
       2,1,1
     2,2,1,1
   2,2,2,1,1

popped index: 0
deque: [4,5]
degrees of freedom: 4 - 0 = 0

Here they are. We can generate 4 different subarrays with these 2s
