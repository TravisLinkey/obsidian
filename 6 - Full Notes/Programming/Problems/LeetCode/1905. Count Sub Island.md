### Overview
We need to count the subislands from `grid2` that exist in `grid1`. A subisland is when an island in `grid2` exists in `grid1`. The entire island in `grid2` must be present in `grid1`. If an island in `grid1` is larger, it still counts as a subisland.

### Strategy
We can simply loop through both `grid1` and `grid2` simutaneously, using [[Flood Fill]] to mark the island in `grid2`. 

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countSubIslands(self, grid1: List[List[int]], grid2: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        R, C = len(grid1), len(grid1[0])
        
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]
        
        seen = [[False] * C for _ in range(R)]
        
        def is_sub_island(x, y):
            q = collections.deque()
            q.append([x, y])
            seen[x][y] = True
            
            good = True
            while q:
                x, y = q.popleft()
                
                if grid1[x][y] == 0:
                    good = False
                    
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    nx, ny = dx+x, dy+y
                    
                    if nx in range(R) and ny in range(C) and grid2[nx][ny] and not seen[nx][ny]:
                        seen[nx][ny] = True
                        q.append([nx, ny])
            
            return good
        
        count = 0
        # loop through both grids simutaneously
        for i in range(R):
            for j in range(C):
                if grid2[i][j] == 1 and not seen[i][j]:
                    if is_sub_island(i, j):
                        count += 1
        return count
```
