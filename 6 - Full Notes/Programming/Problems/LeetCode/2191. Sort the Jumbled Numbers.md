### Overview
This problem gives us an array of integer numbers `nums` and an array `mapping` where each digit `i` should be mapped to digit `j`. Or formally `mapping[i] = j`.

For example:
`mapping = [8,9,4,0,2,1,3,5,7,6], nums = [991,338,38]`

output: `[338,38,991]`

We can see that index = 0 and `mapping[0] = 8`. 

This means `0 -> 8` where `i = 0 and j = 8`.

### Strategy
We know we must loop through every `num` in `nums` and every character in `num`. **O(n)**

Additionally, we will need to sort the mapped results, with highest precedence being the newly mapped value, and second precedence being the original position of the unmapped values.

This means when we have a tie, like `338 -> 007` and `38 -> 07`, we would put `338` first because it appears in the original array `nums` first.

### Explanation
We can be clever and use a form of [[Bitshifting]] by multiplying each digit by 10, to process them from left to right.

Using the built-in `.sort` function in Python, we can easily pass the custom mapping function into the sorting key as a lambda function.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sortJumbled(self, mapping: List[int], nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        def f(x):
            ans = 0
            for c in str(x):
                 ans *= 10
                 ans += mapping[int(c)]
            return ans

        nums.sort(key=lambda x: f(x))
        return nums
```
