### Overview
This problem wants us to add events to a calendar and prevent a 'double booking'. A 'double booking' occurs when:
1. a new event starts before an old event is over.
2. when a new event ends after an old event has began.

### Strategy
We can use Pythons [[SortedList]] module to keep our calendar `events` in order and `bisect_left` to ensure we are searching thru the calendar optimally.

### Explanation
We just need to be careful when checking the two double booking cases.

### Code
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class MyCalendar:
    def __init__(self):
        self.events = SortedList()

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        N = len(self.events)
        index = self.events.bisect_left((start, -1))
        
        # check left event - starts before old event ends
        if index - 1 >= 0:
            _, old_end = self.events[index-1]
            
            if start < old_end:
                return False
        
        # check right event - ends after old event starts
        if index < N:
            old_start, old_end = self.events[index]
            
            if old_start < end and start < old_end:
                return False
            
        self.events.add((start, end))
        return True
```
### Time Complexity
- Storing the calendar events -> O(log n)
- Searching for calendar events -> O(log n)
