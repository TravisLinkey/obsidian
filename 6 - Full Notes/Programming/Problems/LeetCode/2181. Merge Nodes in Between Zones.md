### Overview
For this problem, we need to observe that we are essentially keeping a running total for all nodes in between 0's.

### Strategy
Rather than modify the Linked List in place, which could get complicated, we should instead build a new Linked List with the correct nodes.

### Explanation
We can simply loop thru the first list, keeping a running total when we see a 0. When we see the next consecutive 0, we know we need to create a new node in our result Linked List where the value of that new Node is the current running total. Make sure to move the new Node forward when we create the next Node.

### Implementation
Create a sentinel Node to allow returning the head of the result Linked List. The outer loop will continue while we have a current Node. If our current Node value is 0, begin a while loop until we see the next consecutive 0. Inside this while loop, keep a running total for the creation of our new result Node.

Return the sentinel.next
