### Overview
This problem wants us to find the maximum number of stones we can remove from a 2D grid where each stone shares a row or column with at least one other stone. We want to remove as many stones as possible while keeping the structure of the connected components intact.

In other words, we want to find the number of stones that cannot be removed.

### Strategy
To find the critical stones, we want to create connected components where each connected component corresponds to a group of stones where one stone must remain unremoved (the parent), to maintain the connection.

By connecting the number of connected components using [[Union Find]], you can determine how many stones must remain.

### Explanation
We will create two lookup tables, `xs` and `ys` to store lists of stone indices that share the same `x` or `y` coordinates. In other words, we will put in a `x` or `y` coordinate, and be able to find the indices of (x,y) stone pairs that share that same `x` or `y`.

We should then loop over the lookup tables to create the connected components, using the first stone index as the parent node, and union it with every other stone in the list.

Lastly, since we now have our connected components, loop one last time over the stones (index), and count the number of connected components. This is done by keeping a set of the parents, which will be unique. This is the "critical" set, ie. the coordinates that cannot be removed.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def removeStones(self, stones: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        N = len(stones)
        
        parents = [i for i in range(N)]
        
        def ufind(x):
            if parents[x] != x:
                parents[x] = ufind(parents[x])
            
            return parents[x]
        
        def uunion(a, b):
            ua = ufind(a)
            ub = ufind(b)
            
            parents[ua] = ub
            
        xs = collections.defaultdict(list)
        ys = collections.defaultdict(list)
            
        # Create lookup table for each x and y
        for index, (x, y) in enumerate(stones):
            xs[x].append(index)
            ys[y].append(index)
            
        # Union x's and y's - connected components
        for x in xs.keys():
            parent = xs[x][0]  # use first index as the parent for this connected component
            
            for child in xs[x][1:]:
                uunion(parent, child)
                
        for y in ys.keys():
            parent = ys[y][0]
            
            for child in ys[y][1:]:
                uunion(parent, child)
                
        # Count total connected components
        seen = set()
        for index in range(N):
            seen.add(ufind(index))
        
        # Total removed is compliment of connected components
        return N - len(seen)
```
