### Overview
This problem wants us to find the `kth` distinct character in a string.

This means we want to remove all repeated characters and return the `kth` distinct element in the leftover list.

### Strategy
We can use a [[Frequency Table]] to easily get the value of each character and the number of occurances. We can then iterate through the string, checking for distinct elements, (their count == 1), and reducing the `k`. If `k` is zero, we know we have found the `kth` distinct element.

If we iterate through all of `arr` and we still have `k` > 0, we know that `k` was too large. Just return an empty string.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def kthDistinct(self, arr: List[str], k: int) -> str:
        counter = Counter(arr)
        for v in arr:
            if counter[v] == 1:
                k -= 1
                if k == 0:
                    return v
        return ''
```
