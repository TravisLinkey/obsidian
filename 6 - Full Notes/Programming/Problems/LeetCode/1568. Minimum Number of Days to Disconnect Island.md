### Overview
We are given a grid of cells where a `0` represents water, and a `1` represents land.

This problem wants us to find the minimum number of days to disconnect the grid. 

### Observation
We can narrow the number of cases down to three possible cases:
    - Graph is already disconnected -> 0 days to disconnect grid
    - There is a penninsula (single cell with water on 3 sides) -> 1 days to disconnect grid
    - We can isolate a corner -> 2 days to disconnect grid

### Strategy
We can check for these three cases by using [[Flood Fill]] to count the connected components (Islands). We first check the trivial case (already disconnected).

Next, we will check for the second case, (a penninsula). This occurs if we have a single cell that has water on three sides. To check for this, we just need to find the cell that connects the penninsula to the main land and change it to water. That will create the disconnected islands. 

If we do not have case 1 or case 2, we can disconnect any other possible island by isolating a corner and disconnecting it by flooding its neighbors. (2 cells).

### Explanation
To check for the non-trivial case, the penninsula, we just need to iterate through the entire island, flip on cell and check if this has disconnected the graph. Once we check, we need to flip it back and continue our island traversal.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        R, C = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]

        def disconnected(grid):
            done = [[False] * C for _ in range(R)]
            def fill(sx, sy):
                q = collections.deque()
                q.append((sx, sy))
                done[sx][sy] = True

                while q:
                    x, y = q.popleft()

                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = dx+x, dy+y

                        if nx in range(R) and ny in range(C) and grid[nx][ny] == 1 and not done[nx][ny]:
                            done[nx][ny] = True
                            q.append((nx, ny))

            count = 0
            # Flood Fill entire grid - count connected components
            for x in range(R):
                for y in range(C):
                    if grid[x][y] == 1 and not done[x][y]:
                       count += 1
                       fill(x, y)

                    if count >= 2:
                        return True
            if count == 0:
                return True
            return False
        
        # Case 1: already disconnected
        if disconnected(grid):
            return 0

        # Case 2: penninsula - flip one cell, check if disconnected
        for x in range(R):
            for y in range(C):
                if grid[x][y] == 1:
                    grid[x][y] = 0
                    if disconnected(grid):
                        return 1
                    grid[x][y] = 1

        # Case 3: all other cases, isolate a corner
        return 2
```
