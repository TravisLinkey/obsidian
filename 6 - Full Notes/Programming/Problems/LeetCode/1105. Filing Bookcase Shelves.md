### Overview
This problem wants us to fill up shelves given an array of `books`. Each book in the array has a `height` and `thickness` where `book[i] = [thickness, height]`.

We want to minimize the total bookshelf height by stacking the books in an optimal order. 

### Strategy
This problem is very similar to [[322. Coin Change]] because we know we cannot use a [[Greedy]] solution. Instead we will use a variation of [[Backtracking]] where we can build each shelf given a particular arrangement of books, starting at `book[i]`, where we will try each index.

Each recursive step, we will assume we have a brand new shelf, so `current_width` will be reset with the original `shelfWidth`.

### Explanation
Since we know we want to try each book in the array, (for each shelf), we will need a for-loop in the recursive step. Each time we use a book, we will reduce the `current_width` and check for a new `max_height`.

Our solution is the returned response from the recursive call plus the current `max_height` at each recursive step.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minHeightShelves(self, books: List[List[int]], shelfWidth: int) -> int:
        INF = 10 ** 20
        N = len(books)

        has_cache = [False] * (N+1)
        cache = [None] * (N+1)

        def create(index):
            if index == N:
                return 0

            if has_cache[index]:
                return cache[index]
            
            current_width = shelfWidth
            max_height = 0
            best = INF

            for i in range(index, N):
                width, height = books[i]
                if current_width < width:
                    break
                current_width -= width
                max_height = max(max_height, height)
                best = min(best, create(i+1) + max_height)
            
            has_cache[index] = True
            cache[index] = best
            return best
        return create(0)
```
