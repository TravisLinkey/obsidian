### Overview
This problem wants us to add two numbers, given as Linked Lists. They are written backwards, which is convenient because this is the way we would naturally add two large numbers.

### Strategy
Iterate through each linked list at the same time, until they are both empty nodes keeping a carry for when the add to a value greater than 10. If one of them is empty, use the value 0 in the addition instead.

Don't forget to check for a carry bit after looping through both linked lists. 

### Explanation
Honestly, the tricky part of this problem is the implementation. Below is the best one I can find.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode()

        current = dummy
        carry = 0
        while l1 or l2:
            val1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            val2 = l2.val if l2 else 0

            val = val1 + val2 + carry
            carry = val // 10
            val %= 10

            current.next = ListNode(val)

            current = current.next
            l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
            l2 = l2.next if l2 else None

        if carry:
            current.next = ListNode(1)

        return dummy.next
```
