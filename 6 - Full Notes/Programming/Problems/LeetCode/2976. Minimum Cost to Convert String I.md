### Overview
We need to convert some string `source` to another string `target` using a mapping (`original` -> `changed`) that is described by three arrays, (`original`, `changed`, `cost`) with the absolute minimum cost.

Because some elements in the mapping can be repeated, with different costs, we can see that this is very similar to a graph with weighted edges between nodes.

### Strategy
We know that we can sometimes convert an element from `source` to an element in `target` by using a combination of operations, moving from one character in the mapping to another. In other words, rather than a direct connection from one element to another, we can choose to first convert some element in `source` to another element, then convert that element into something in `target`.

This is analagous to traveling across two edges, with less cost, rather than traveling across a single edge that may cost more, like connecting flights that would be faster than a single flight.


### Explanation
Because there are only 26 letters in the English language, we can create a weight matrix from every character to every other character. We can then use the arrays they give us, `original`, `changed`, `cost`, and [[Floyd-Warshall]] algorithm to find the minimum cost from one character to another, including connecting edges.

After, we simply traverse the array `source` and `target`, calculating the total cost, (which we know will be minimum), for each element in `source` -> `destination`.


### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumCost(self, source: str, target: str, original: List[str], changed: List[str], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        INF = 10 ** 20
        ALPHA = 26
        d = [[INF] * ALPHA for _ in range(ALPHA)]

        for s, t, c in zip(original, changed, cost):
            s = ord(s) - ord('a')
            t = ord(t) - ord('a')

            d[s][t] = min(d[s][t], c)

        # Floyd-Warshall
        for k in range(ALPHA):
            for i in range(ALPHA):
                for j in range(ALPHA):
                    d[i][j] = min(d[i][j], d[i][k] + d[k][j])

        total = 0
        for s, t in zip(source, target):
            if s == t:
                continue
            
            s = ord(s) - ord('a')
            t = ord(t) - ord('a')
            if d[s][t] >= INF:
                return -1

            total += d[s][t]

        return total
```
