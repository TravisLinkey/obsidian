### Overview
This problem wants us to add characters to the front of a string `s` until it becomes a palindrome.

We should return the **shortest** palindrome you can find after adding characters as a prefix.

### Strategy
This is a tricky problem. One observation is that we achieve the **shortest** palindrome (after adding prefix characters), by first identifying the **longest** palindrome in the string, and adding the necessary characters to the left.

One way to do this is called the [[Rabin Karp]] algorithm, where we compute a [[Rolling Hash]] going thru the string forwards (prefix hash) and backwards (suffix hash) and comparing them. When they match, we have found a palindrome in the array.

### Explanation
To compute the prefix hash, we will need to shift the characters left by multiplying our current prefix by the base and adding the character. We choose 29 as the base because of the number of characters in the alphabet. 29 is chosen because it is prime and will prevent collisions.

We can do the same for the suffix hash, but we will shift them instead by the current character multiplied by our power, which increases each time by a factor of the base, (29^0 + 29^1 + 29^2 + ...).

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        prefix, suffix = 0, 0
        base, power = 29, 1
        last_index = 0
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        for idx, c in enumerate(s):
            char = (ord(c) - ord('a') + 1)
            
            prefix = (prefix * base) % MOD
            prefix = (prefix + char) % MOD
            
            suffix = (suffix + (char * power)) % MOD
            
            power = (power * base) % MOD
            
            if prefix == suffix:
                last_index = idx
        
        # add suffix (reversed) to front of string
        suffix = s[last_index + 1:]
        return suffix[::-1] + s
```
