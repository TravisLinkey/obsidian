### Overview
We are given a Directed Acyclic Graph [[DAG]] and we want to return a list of ancestors (parents, and parents of parents) for each node in the DAG

### Strategy
We can use [[Topological Sort]] to traverse the graph, adding visited nodes to the answer array.

### Explanation
One interesting thing to note about this problem is we need to return the list of ancestor nodes in sorted order, without duplicates. This can be done using a set. 

However, using a set means when we add all the parent nodes ancestors (previously visited nodes), we must use a set union.

In Python, this can be done using `set_a.union(set_b)` or with the `|=` operator.
