### Overview
We are given a [[BST]] and we must return a *balanced* binary search tree with the same node values.

A binary search tree is balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

### Strategy
If we are clever, we will notice that the invariant, both subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1, essentially tells us we can use the property of a [[BST]] to ensure we have an equal amount of nodes in the left and right subtree.

### Explanation
We can get the nodes in a sorted order by traversing the tree with an [[In Order Traversal]] and saving it to an array. We can then recursively construct the new tree using the middle node as the new root, with everything to the left of the middle point as the left subtree, and everything to the right as the right subtree.
