### Overview
This problem gives us an integer `k` that represents the number of chalk, and a list `chalk` that represents how much chalk each student will consume. 

We need to return the index of the student that will run out of chalk, assuming we start at the beginning of the `chalk` array each cycle.

### Observation
We notice that we only care about the very last cycle, specifically what is the index that it will end on.

### Strategy
To simulate jumping to the very last cycle, we can sum up the entire `chalk` array, which represents the number of total chalk consumed per cycle. We can then simulate jumping to the last cycle by modding `k` (total chalk), by the number of chalk consumed each cycle, (`sum(chalk))`.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def chalkReplacer(self, chalk: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # number of chalk consumed each cycle
        total = sum(chalk)

        k %= total
    
        # loop thru last cycle  
        for i, x in enumerate(chalk):
            k -= x
            
            if k < 0:
                return i
        assert(false)
```
