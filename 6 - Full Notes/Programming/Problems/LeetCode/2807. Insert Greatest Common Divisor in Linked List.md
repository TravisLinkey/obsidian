### Overview
This problem wants us to take every adjacent node in a linked list and insert a new node in between that has a value equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD).

### Strategy
This can be easily accomplished in [[Python]] using the built in `math.gcd` function.

We will continue our loop while there is a `next` node, because we want to terminate when the next node is `null`.

### Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def insertGreatestCommonDivisors(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        cur = head
        while cur.next:
            cur.next = ListNode(math.gcd(cur.val, cur.next.val), cur.next)
            cur = cur.next.next
            
        return head
```
