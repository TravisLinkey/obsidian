### Overview
The properties of [[XOR]] allow us to find the missing number efficiently.

### Strategy
    - Any number XOR with itself is 0
    - Any number XOR with 0 is the number itself

With this in mind, we just need to do the following steps:
    1. XOR all the numbers 1 to n.
    2. XOR all the numbers in the array.
    3. XOR the results of step one and two to find the missing number.

### Explanation
Every number that is present in `nums` array will cancel out its corresponding number in the complete range due to the XOR properties mentioned above. Therefore, the only number that will not be cancelled out is the missing number.

```python
def find_missing_number(arr, n):
    # XOR all numbers from 1 to n
    xor_full = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        xor_full ^= i

    # XOR all numbers in the array
    xor_arr = 0
    for num in arr:
        xor_arr ^= num

    # XOR the results to get the missing number
    missing_number = xor_full ^ xor_arr
    return missing_number
```
