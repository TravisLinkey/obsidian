### Overview
This problem is really difficult.

Essentially, we need to return the **second** fastest time to arrive at a destination (city N) given the `red light, green light` constraint. I will explain that later.

We can achieve this by doing a [[BFS]] from the start node (0-indexed) to the destination node.

### Strategy
The trick here is to process each neighbor in parallel, by layers, so that we can correctly follow the `red light, green light` constraint. This will ensure that during a red light, (interval), we are not moving from our current node, to the neighbor node.

The `red light, green light` constraint means we cannot move during a red light, and we cannot stop during a green light. So, if we arrive at a neighbor node during a green light interval, we must proceed, if we arrive at the neighbor node during a red light interval, we must stop until the next green light.

### Explanation
One last thing to keep in mind is: we do not want to return the **fastest** arrival time, but instead, the **second** fastest time. If there is a tie for first, they are both considered the **fastest**. In other words, if two paths arrive at the destination at the same time, do not return either of them.

The math for calculating if we arrive at a red light interval is the following: `(cur_time // change) % 2 == 1` (aka, is the current time divided by change odd?) 

#### Ex: cur_time = 12, change = 5
is_red_light = (12 // 5) % 2 == 1 
is_red_light = (2) % 2 = 1
is_red_light = False


### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def secondMinimum(self, N: int, edges: List[List[int]], time: int, change: int) -> int:
        
        adj_list = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:
            u -= 1
            v -= 1

            adj_list[u].append(v)
            adj_list[v].append(u)

        q = collections.deque()
        q.append(0)
        cur_time = 0

        found = -1
        visit_times = defaultdict(list)  # node -> [visit]
        while q:
            # process by layers
            for i in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                if node == N-1:
                    if found != -1:
                        return cur_time
                    found = 0
                
                for nei in adj_list[node]:
                    nei_times = visit_times[nei]

                    # do not add duplicate arrival times
                    if len(nei_times) == 0 or (len(nei_times) == 1 and nei_times[0] != cur_time):
                        q.append(nei)
                        nei_times.append(cur_time)
            
            # red lights are odd intervals
            is_red_light = (cur_time // change) % 2 == 1
            if (is_red_light):
                cur_time += (change - (cur_time % change))  # go to next available green
            cur_time += time
```
