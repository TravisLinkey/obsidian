## Overview

We need to return a list of lists containing the [[lexicographically]] smallest products from a list `products` at each character of the word `searchWord`. (only return the top 3 results)

### Solution

To achieve this, first, we need to sort the array `products` to ensure the words are we are looking for are lexicographically in the correct order. 

Next, we will loop through the word `searchWord`, using a left and right pointer in the product array.  (left at beginning of product array, right at the end)

Move the left pointer and right pointer when the product does not contain the character in `searchWord`.

Lastly, at the end of each loop, add the top 3 products, (using the left pointer) or the remaining products, if less than 3 remain.

### Code

```python
def suggestedProducts(products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]: 
	N = len(products) 
	products.sort() 
	
	l, r = 0, N-1 
	ans = [] 
	
	for i in range(len(searchWord)): 
		char = searchWord[i] 
		
		while l <= r and (len(products[l]) <= i or products[l][i] != char):
			l += 1 
		
		while l <= r and (len(products[r]) <= i or products[r][i] != char):
			r -= 1 ans.append([]) 
		
		remaining = r-l+1
		for j in range(min(3, remaining)): 
			ans[-1].append(products[l+j])
	
	return ans
```
