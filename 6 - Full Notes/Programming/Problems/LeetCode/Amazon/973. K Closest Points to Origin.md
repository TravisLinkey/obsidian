## Overview

We need to find the points that are closest to the origin from an array of (x, y) coordinates called `points`.

To do this, we use the distance formula: `distance = sqrt((x_1 + x_2)**2 + (y_1 + y_2)**2)` for each point in the array `points` and store this in an array `distances` where each element is in the form: `(distance, x, y)`.

All we need to do is sort `distances` and take the top `k` elements.

### Code

```python
def kClosest(points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]: 
	N = len(points) 
	distances = []
	
	for x, y in points: 
		d = math.sqrt((x**2) + (y**2)) 
		distances.append([d, x, y]) 
	
	distances.sort(key=lambda x: -x[0]) 
	ans = [] 
	
	while k > 0: 
		d, x, y = distances.pop() 
		ans.append([x, y]) 
		k -= 1
		
	return ans
```
