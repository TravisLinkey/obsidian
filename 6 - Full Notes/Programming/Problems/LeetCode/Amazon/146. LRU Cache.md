## Overview

This question wants us to create a Data Structure to follow the constraints of a LRU Cache. The idea is our class (that we implement) will need to take a `capacity` that we will use as an invariant to ensure our cache does not get too large.

### Solution

We can implement this class easily by extending the python `collections` class `OrderedDict`. This class has a function `move_to_end(key)` that we can use mark a key as recently accessed, by moving it to the end of the dictionary.

In other words, when a key is accessed using our classes `get` method, we will move the key to the end of the dictionary.

When a key-value pair is added to the cache, we will pop from our cache if the size of the cache is greater than `capacity`.

### Code

```python

from collections import OrderedDict 

class LRUCache(OrderedDict): 
	def __init__(self, capacity: int): 
		self.capacity = capacity
		
	def get(self, key: int) -> int: 
		if key in self: 
			self.move_to_end(key) 
			return self[key] 
		return -1 
		
	def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None: 
		self[key] = value 
		if len(self) > self.capacity: 
			self.popitem(last=False) 
			self.move_to_end(key) 

# Your LRUCache object will be instantiated and called as such: 
# obj = LRUCache(capacity) 
# param_1 = obj.get(key) 
# obj.put(key,value)

```
