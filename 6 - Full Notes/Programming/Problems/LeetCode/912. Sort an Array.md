### Overview
The problem wants us to sort an array in `O(nlog(n))` time. This is a dead givaway that the problem is wanting a [[Merge Sort]]. `O(n)` to split the numbers `O(log(n))` to merge them.

### Strategy
We know we need to continuously split the array until it is a list of single element lists.

Once we have completely finished the `mergeSort` recursion, we will have our single element lists, we can begin merging.

### Explanation
To merge, we simply just compare the left and right elements, and select the one that is smaller, appending it to an answers array.


### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def sortArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        def mergeSort(arr):
            if len(arr) < 2:
                return arr

            # split
            mid = len(arr) // 2
            left = mergeSort(arr[:mid])
            right = mergeSort(arr[mid:])

            # merge
            ans = []
            i = j = 0
            while left and right:
                if left[0] < right[0]:
                    ans.append(left.pop(0))
                else:
                    ans.append(right.pop(0))
            
            if left:
                ans.extend(left)
            if right:
                ans.extend(right)

            return ans

        return mergeSort(nums)
        
```
