### Overview
This defines a printer with two simple operations: 
1. print any number of the same character.
2. overwrite any number of new characters starting from any index.

### Observation
Simply printing from left to right will lead us to the worst case, `N` operations.

Instead, we need to think in terms of subproblems and ensure we are combining similar characters to arrive at the optimal solution.

### Strategy
The string `aba`string can be broken up in two ways: 
1. `a | ba`  -> 3 operations
2. `ab | a`  -> 3 operations

Both of these divided strings lead to 3 operations. However, by combining the left `a` and the right `a`, we arrive at the optimal solution -> 2 operations.
1. `a |b| a` -> 2 operations
    i  k  j  -> dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j]

### Explanation
By processing similar characters on the left and right together, (combining the operation), we will arrive at the optimal solution. This requires we keep a `dp` array for each index `i` and `j` and loop over all possible `k`.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def strangePrinter(self, s: str) -> int:
        N = len(s)

        has_cache = [[False] * N for _ in range(N)]
        cache = [[None] * N for _ in range(N)]

        def get_min(i, j):
            if i > j:
                return 0
            if i == j:
                return 1

            if has_cache[i][j]:
                return cache[i][j]

            # Dont match first letter 
            best = 1 + get_min(i+1, j)

            # look for all possible dividers
            for k in range(i+1, j+1):

                # First and last letter match, add divider at index k
                if s[i] == s[k]:
                    best = min(best, get_min(i, k-1) + get_min(k+1, j))

            has_cache[i][j] = True
            cache[i][j] = best
            return best

        return get_min(0, N-1)
```
