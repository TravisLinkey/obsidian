### Overview
A functional programming language that has strong [[Concurrency]] support for building scalable back ends.

It runs on the [[Erlang Virtual Machine]] which makes it well suited for [[Distributed Systems]], real-time applications, and web servers.

### Key Concepts
- [[Functional Programming]]
- [[Concurrency]]
- [[Fault Tolerance]]
- [[Phoenix]]
- [[Pattern Matching]]
- Interoperability with [[Erlang]]
- [[Metaprogramming]]
- [[Native Function]]

### Key Points
- Scalability and Fault Tolerance
- Functional Programming and Immutability: Emphasizes [[Pure Function]], [[Immutability]], and [[Declarative Programming]]
- Concurrency Model: Leverages lightweight processes, the [[Actor Model]], and [[Supervisors]] for fault-tolerant concurrency.
- [[Phoenix]]: Key for building real-time, performant web applications in Elixir.
