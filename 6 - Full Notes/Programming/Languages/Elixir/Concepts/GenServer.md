### Overview
A powerful abstraction for creating [[Processes]] with a standard interface for handling synchronous and asynchronous requests, managing state, and dealing with messages.

### Details
- Encapsulates the complexity of working directly with processes, making it easier to build stateful applications.
- You can define a GenServer by implementing the `GenServer` behavior, which provides callbacks, like `handle_call/3`, `handle_cast/2` and `handle_info/2`
