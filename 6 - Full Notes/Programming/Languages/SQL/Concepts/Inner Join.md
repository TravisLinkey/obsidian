### Overview
Combines records from two or more tables when there are matching values in a shared column.

The main difference between [[Inner Join]] and [[Outer Join]] is what happens when the join condition doesn't match.

In the [[Inner Join]], rows that don't match the join condition are rejected and not included in the result.
