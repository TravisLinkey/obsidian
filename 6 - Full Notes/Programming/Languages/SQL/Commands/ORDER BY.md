### Overview
`ORDER BY` is used to sort the result set in either ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```
This retrieves all employee names and their salaries, sorting the results by salary in descending order. (Highest to lowest)
