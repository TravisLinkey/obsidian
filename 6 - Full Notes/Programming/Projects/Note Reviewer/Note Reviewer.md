### Overview
This project aims to create a dashboard for notes that need reviewed. This will help encourage knowledge retention for notes and create a system for reviewing old notes that have been created.

### CRUD Operations

- PUT a note
- PUT note reviewed
- PUT note location

### Future improvements
- Turn this into an open source Obsidian plugin!
- Allow a note to be marked for review at a future day (recurring notifications)
