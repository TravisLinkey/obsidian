### Overview
A conversation with Max led him to say something that made a lot of sense to me. I paraphrase:
`Avoiding negativity is more beneficial than trying to balance negativity with positivity`

### Reaction 
I think this is a valuable approach because negative thoughts are counterproductive and draining. Trying to combat negative thoughts with positive thoughts takes more energy than stopping negative thoughts from growing in the first place.  

Identifying negative thoughts and actively avoiding them, (with the realization that they are counterproductive), is more effective than trying to cope by creating a positive outlookon a negative situation.

This does not mean we can avoid all negativity. The world is a hostile place, and negative events and people are inevitable. Learning to handle negativity is easier done when you realize that it is an inevitable fact of life, and dwelling on it does not lead to positive outcomes. 

### Counter Argument
According to ChatGPT, "Avoidance can lead to suppression", and supressing negativity doesn't make it go away; instead, it can manifest in other detrimental ways, like anxiety and depression. 

### Response
I am not advocating people supress negativity, but avoid it wherever possible. This does not mean do not take risks or have fun, but instead, foster a positive attitude and resilience by actively recognizing a thought as negative or positive or neutral when it presents itself. Notice how many of your thoughts are full of self-doubt, and dispense them if they are. 

I would argue instead, that it is impossible balance all of the negativity the world can present you with a counter positivity, and it is best to minimize negative thoughts and people from affecting or regulating your mood.
