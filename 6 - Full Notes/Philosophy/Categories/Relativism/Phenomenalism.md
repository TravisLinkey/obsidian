### Overview
Claims reality can only be understood as being dependent on sensory phenomena.

### Details
Objects only exist as they are perceived, the nature of those objects could be seen as relative to the perceiver's experience.

### Famous Examples
- [[George Berkeley]] - "to be is to be perceived"
- [[John Stuart Mill]] - objects are not things in themselves but are instead a collection of sensory perceptions. He claimed objects are merely, "permanent possibilities of sensation".
