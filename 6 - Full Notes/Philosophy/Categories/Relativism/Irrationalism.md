### Overview
Emphasizes the limits of rationality, often rejecting the idea that reason is the primary path to understanding reality. 

### Detail
The statement: "That mountain is 100 feet tall", would be denied by an irrationalist because they would deny the validity of objective measurements or rational standards.

They would instead argue that non-rational beings cannot percieve or understand the concept of measurement, therefore it cannot describe reality.

### Famous Examples
- [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] - Challenged enlightenment emphasis on reason as the path to truth. He argued that human life is driven more by will, instincts, and passions than by rational thought. 

- [[Soren Kierkegaard]] - "Leap of faith", certain truths cannot be reached through rationality alone and require personal, subjective commitement that defies reason.
