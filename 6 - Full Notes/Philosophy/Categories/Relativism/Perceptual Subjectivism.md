### Overview
Reality is dependent on the perciever's senses or cognitive abilities.

### Details
In this view, the statment, "The mountain is 100 feet tall" depends on the perceiver's ability to conceptualize or measure "100 feet".

Since different beings percieve the world differently, they might argue that objective measurements are not universally valid.

### Famous Examples
- [[David Hume]] - All knowledge comes from sensory perceptions.
- [[Immanuel Kant]] - Knoledge of the world is shaped by our mind
    - "noumenon" - "Objective Reality" -> unknowable
    - "phenomenon" - "Subjective Experience" -> world that we percieve
