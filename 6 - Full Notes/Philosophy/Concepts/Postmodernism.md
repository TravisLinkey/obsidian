### Overview
All truths are considered equally valid based on subjective experience.

This philosophy is characterized by skepticism toward grand narratives, objective truths,
and fixed meanings.

### Famous Examples
- [[Jean-Francois Lyotard]] (1924-1998) - Argument knowledge is fragemented and decentralized. Skeptic towards "grand narratives".

- [[Michel Foucault]] (1926-1984) - Examined the relationship between power, knowledge and social institutions. Argued what we consider to be "truth" is shaped by power dynamics and that institutions like prisons, hospitals, and schools play a role in maintaining these truths.
