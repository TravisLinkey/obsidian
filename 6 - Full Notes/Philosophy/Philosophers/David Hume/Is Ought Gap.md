aka. Hume's Guillotine

### Overview
The idea that you cannot derive a prescriptive statement (what should be) from a descriptive statement (what is).

In other words, there must be a justification for moving from a **descriptive statement** to a **normative statement** (prescriptive action or value).

### Example
Descriptive Statement (is): "In many animal species, stronger individuals dominate weaker ones to gain access to resources."

Faulty Moral Conclusion (Ought): "Therefore, it is acceptable for stronger humans to dominate weaker ones to obtain resources."

### Summary
The leap from observing natural behavior to prescribing human moral actions crosses the is-ought gap without justification. Just because dominance occurs in nature does not mean it is acceptable for humans to emulate this behavior.

To justify this, one would need to introduce additional notmative premises, such as "What occurs in nature is morally right", which would itself require further justification.

### Conclusion
- *Descriptive facts alone are insufficient* for deriving moral obligations.
- *Normative premises are necessary* to bridge the gap between 'is' and 'ought'.
- *Careful reasoning is essential* in ethical discussions to avoid unwarranted conclusions.
