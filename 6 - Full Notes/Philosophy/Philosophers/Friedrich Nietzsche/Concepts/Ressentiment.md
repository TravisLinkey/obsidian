### Overview
A psychological state of deep-seated resentment, hostitily, and envy that arises in individuals or groups who feel powerless, oppressed, or inferior. 

Instead of openly confronting their powerlessness, people with ressentiment often internalize their grievances, transforming their feelings of weakness and inferiority into a moral condemnation of those who are strong or successful.
