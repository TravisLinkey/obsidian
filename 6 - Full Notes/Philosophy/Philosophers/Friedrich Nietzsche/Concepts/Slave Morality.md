### Overview
Devaluing what the [[Master Morality]] values and what the slave does not have.

A reaction to oppression, it elevates the weak and vilifies its oppresors.

### Details
Characterized by pessimism and cynicism, it inverts what is considered good by careful subversion.

It does not seek to transcend the masters, but to make them slaves as well. 

### Analysis
The essence of slave morality is **utility**. This would entail "The good is what is most useful for the whole community, not just the strong".

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] would see this as a contradiction. Since the powerful are few compared to the masses of the weak, the weak gain power by corrupting the strong into believing that the causes of slavery, (the [[Will to Power]]) are evil, as are the qualities the weak originally could not choose because of their weakness.

### Details
By saying humility is voluntary, slave morality avoids admitting that their humility was in the beginning forced upon them by a master.
