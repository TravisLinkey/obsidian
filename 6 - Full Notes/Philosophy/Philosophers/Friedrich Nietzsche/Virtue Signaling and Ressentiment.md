### Overview
Virtue signaling represents a public display of moral superiority by individuals who, feeling powerless or resentful, seek to undermine and criticize the strong or successful.

Rather than confronting their inferiority directly, they signal their virtues as a way of reinforcing the moral code of [[Slave Morality]], which values traits like humility and meekness over strength and power. 

Serves as a subtle, indirect form of expressing ressentiment while maintaining the appearace of moral purity.
