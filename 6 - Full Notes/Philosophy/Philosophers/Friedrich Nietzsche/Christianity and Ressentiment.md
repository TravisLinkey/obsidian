### Overview
According to Nietzsche, **Christianity is a religion born out of [[Ressentiment]]**. 

Chritianity was developed by the weak and powerless as a way to gain psychological and moral superiority over the strong. 

Nietzsche believed that early Christians were largely oppressed, poor, and weak (physically and socially), and they created a moral system that inverted traditional values of strength, power, and nobility.

### Suffering as Virtue
Christians are offered comfort by the promising of an afterlife and labeling virtues of the strong, (power, wealth, domination) as sinful and morally inferior.

This allows the weak to assert their moral superiority by framing their suffering as a sign of virtue.

Humility, charity and meekness are the products of [[Ressentiment]] and allow Christians to place moral value on their suffereing and rejection of worldly power.

### Life Denial and Nihilism
They prefer self-denial instead of strength and self-assertion. According to Nietzsche, this is a form of life-denial or [[Nihilism]], where the highest human potentials are suppressed in favor of mediocrity and passivity.
