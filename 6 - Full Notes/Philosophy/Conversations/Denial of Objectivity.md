### Overview
In a conversation with Max, he claims **Everything is Subjective**.

He even struggles to believe a mountain can be objectively "100 feet tall".

### Claim
His claim was that an animal cannot comprehend what "100 feet tall" is, therefore it is not objectively true that a mountain is "100 feet tall".

### Details
This claim shows a lack of understanding between the difference between subjective experiences and objective facts.

His perspective demonstrates [[Relativism]] or [[Subjectivism]], and borders on [[Postmodernism]]. 

See:
    - [[Irrationalism]]
    - [[Perceptual Subjectivism]]
    - [[Phenomenalism]]

### Counter Arguments
1. Explain the difference between measurements and perception.
2. Use other universally measureable examples.
    - "Does water at sea level boil at 100 degrees Celsius?"
3. Highlight the difference between [[Epistemic Access]] and [[Ontological Reality]]

### Further details
He later did make the claim that an animal that does not have an ability to perceive water as wet, would prove that water is not objectively wet. This is classic [[Irrationalism]].
