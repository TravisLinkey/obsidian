### Overview
I had a theory that California used to be primarily republican, and for the most part, a nice state. (Low crime, high-income citizens, housing was affordable)

This proven correct by related statistics that can be summarized as the following:
1. California used to be Republican
2. Democrats took over
3. [[White flight]] and [[Replacement Theory]]
4. California is now trash. (High crime, soaring housing prices, overpopulation, illegal immigration and homelessness)

### Historical Context
- 1950-1960: California mostly Republican.
- 1970 - Shift begins with [[Jerry Brown]] as governor in 1974.
- 1990 - [[Bill Clinton]] wins California in the 1992 persidential election.

### Voting Percentage
- 1980: Republicans had a substantial lead, 
    - 40-45% of registered voters Republican
    - 35-45% Democrat
- Early 2020: Democrats make up majority of voters
    - 46% of registered voters
    - 24% Republican
